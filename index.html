      <h2>Why You Should Consider Responsive Design for Your Website!</h2>
        <p>So, what is the big deal about Responsive design? Everyone is talking about it- and if you don’t have it, well you’re considered behind the times.
        In a nutshell- here are 2 major reasons why Responsive Design on your website is a big deal:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> The desktop browsing experience for individuals outside of their desk job is limited- especially if you fall into the millennial generation!
            Tablets and Smartphones rule the viewing platforms of the world today. But if you website isn’t equipped for a smaller than 12” inch screen- your missing out.
            Responsive design allows the user on the go using smaller devices to still access the information they want and need! </li>
            <br>
            <li>Let’s say you have your main website- and you have a mobile one too. That’s awesome- but guess what? Every time you update or do something on your main website,
            you then have to apply the same work all over again to your mobile site. With Responsive Design- no need. Everything lives under one URL!!!! </li>
          </ol>
